# Analyze A/B Test Results


## Dataset

An e-commerce website has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Summary of Findings

Based on the comprehensive Practical Statistics, we don't have significant evidence to suggest that the new page results in more conversions than the old page. The e-commerce company should run the experiment longer to make their decision regarding old and new page coversions as the ab_data dataset consists of limited timestamp duration.
